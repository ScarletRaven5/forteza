  "introTitle": "Poste: The Guards of the Longsword",
  "introText": "Each Italian master-at-arms had a similar, yet distinct series of guards or <i>poste</i> (stations/seats) for the longsword. These poste don't really \"guard\" anything. Rather, they are the natural starting and ending points of the eight cuts and four thrusts of the longsword. As such, they are also interconnected; the swordsman will flow from poste to poste in the course of a sword fight. Each guard <i>does</i> make it naturally difficult to strike one target, while leaving another area inherently vulnerable. A good swordsman understands this relationship, and uses it to manipulate his opponent to attack where he desires. <b>For example, the Half Iron Door makes it difficult to strike the legs, while seemingly leaving the head vulnerable. Knowing this, a good swordsman will anticipate an attack to the head, and be able to instantly lift his sword in such a way to parry the blow, and leave his adversary vulnerable.</b> <br><br>In <i>Il Fior di Battaglia</i> (\"The Flower of Battle\"), Fiore dei Liberi defines twelve principle guards for the two-handed sword, and shows several variations of some. You will find these illustrated in the Appendices. Of these twelve, we will use nine in this course.",

And she is good to await every manual weapon, long and short, and for which it has a good sword, that is not too long. And she passes with a cover and goes to the close. She exchanges the thrust and places her own. She also beats the thrusts to the ground and always goes with a pass to the close and against all blows she makes a cover. And standing in this guard, one may easily make defense against anyone who bothers him.",
      "description": "This last <i>invitational</i> guard is closely related to both Porta di Ferro Mezzana, and Posta di Donna. From Porta di Ferro Mezzana, step back with your right foot, and let your right hand turn palm up, so that the hilt of the sword lies across your groin and the blade is angled down and to your right. The name \"Iron Gate\" for these positions refers to its ability to defend against any attaack by striking up from below to bind or beat cute and thrusts aside. Although it appears to be at rest, it can also make strong cuts and thrusts; so much so, that it can be said that anything Posta di Donna can do, Posta Tutta Porta di Ferro can as well.",

It defends the same way it attacks: by striking. This guard can be formed with either a forward stance (shown), or a backward stance, and you can move freely from one to the other with a <i>volta stabile</i>. Keep the torso coiled back, with the left arm relatively straight and close to the body to avoid your elbow being a target. You should stand in the guard with a feeling of confidence, as if you are going to dominate the opponent with your will.",

Like Posta di Donna, there are both left and right, forward and backward-weighted variations of this guard. Like Posta Longa, the Window Guard keeps the opponent back by threatening with a thrust. Unlike Longa, however, it is not held so extended, and thus is vulnerable to attacks made to the opposite side of the body. Finestra is a subtle position, and until you are comfortable with it, it is best to move through, rather than to lie in for an extended period of time.",

As we will see later, it can use this same basic motion to attack or parry with rising blow (sottani) with the false edge. This guard is formed with a forward stance.

Here though it is mentioned that the rising blow from this guard can be aimed at the sword, as a cover, where in the previous version, the only targets mentioned are the head, arms and hands. So, you may parry from here (much as from the middle iron door). Given that the measure must be quite long for you to be safely in this guard, it is not surprising that the hands are the principle target (\"always destroys the hands, sometimes the head and the arms\").",
